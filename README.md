This repository contains framework code for Pixel 7 Pro on Android 14 Beta 1, version tag UPB1.230309.014.

Please note that it only contains files that [my tool](https://sithi.me/projects/suze/) was able to discover and decompile properly. It breaks <sub>even more often than it usually does</sub> while reversing APEX files, so some parts might be incomplete.

JARs were decompiled using JADX's "show bad code" option, so some parts of the source code might also be inconsistent with the actual behavior of the device. This will probably be noted with comments from the decompiler next to the code.
